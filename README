1 - About Bricks-OS
-------------------
  Bricks-OS is an Operating System primarily for Game Consoles. It's goal is to
  be a microkernel based network distributed operating system. This is achieved
  by using messages to communicate (like Minix/QNX).
  
  Example: A Gameboy Advance (GBA) can communicate with a GameCube (NGC). If
  they setup a communication channel the GBA can use all resources of the NGC,
  instantly giving the GBA access to a network adapter, DVD drive, high
  resolution display and more.
  
  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
  accompanying COPYING file for more details. 

2 -  How to compile
-------------------
  Bricks-OS currently compiles using devkitPro (http://www.devkitpro.org/)
  under windows. It should be able to compile under other operating systems as
  well but this has not been tested.
  The "BRICKS_ROOT" environment variable is needed for Bricks-OS to compile.
  Pointing to the root directory of the Bricks-OS source.
  The command line is as follows:
    make -f Makefile.${TARGET} clean all
  
  This will result in a binary located at:
    $(BRICKS_ROOT)/bin/$(TARGET)/Bricks.elf

  Example (for Gameboy Advance):
    make -f Makefile.gba clean all

3 - How to use
--------------
  Currently Bricks-OS will show a welcoming message. On some platforms it will
  also display key presses. Message:
