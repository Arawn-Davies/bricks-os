1 - About Bricks-OS
-------------------
  Bricks-OS is an Operating System primarily for Game Consoles. It's goal is to
  be a microkernel based network distributed operating system. This is achieved
  by using messages to communicate (like Minix/QNX).
  
  Example: A Gameboy Advance (GBA) can communicate with a GameCube (NGC). If
  they setup a communication channel the GBA can use all resources of the NGC,
  instantly giving the GBA access to a network adapter, DVD drive, high
  resolution display and more.
  
  It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
  accompanying COPYING file for more details. 

2 -  How to compile
-------------------
  The "BRICKS_ROOT" environment variable is needed for Bricks-OS to compile.
  Pointing to the root directory of the Bricks-OS source.
  After the BRICKS_ROOT has been set, the following command line can be used
  to build bricks:
    make -f Makefile.${TARGET} clean all
  
  Examples:
    make -f Makefile.gba clean all
    make -f Makefile.nds clean all
    make -f Makefile.ngc clean all
    make -f Makefile.ps2 clean all
    make -f Makefile.psp clean all
    make -f Makefile.pc  clean all

  After succesfully building Bricks-OS the binary file will be located at:
    $(BRICKS_ROOT)/bin/$(TARGET)/Bricks.elf

  Please note that the appropriate development environment will also need to
  be installed. Currently I am using devkitPro for most platforms (see 3.)
