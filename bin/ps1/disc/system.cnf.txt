The boot procedure of the Playstation comes in two flavors. Hardware Mode and Application Boot.

Hardware mode corresponds to booting the actual hardware.

Application boot jumps to a specific address in ROM and performs a check of the hardware. Next, it checks to see what type of disc is in the Playstation. If it's a Playstation disc, it gets the system designation file (SYSTEM.CNF) and executes it.

If there is no disc, it goes into looping demonstration.


The SYSTEM.CNF is basically the Autoexec.bat of the Playstation. Each section is as follows:

BOOT: Specify the name of the file to be started. The default is GAME.PSX.
Example: BOOT = PSXAPP.EXE

TCB: Specify the number of tasks. The default is 4.
Example: TCB = 5

EVENT: Specify the number of events. The default is 16.
Example: Event = 5

STACK: The stack pointer value when the file specified by BOOT is started. Default is 0x8001FF00.
Example: STACK = 800FFF0
