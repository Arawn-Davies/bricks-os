From the "NOT YAROZE" website:

Creation of CD-R

First, made ISO image file which is CD-ROM-XA mode 2 and the file name of ISO Level1.
Next, the area code in 16 top sectors (37632 bytes) is extracted from real CD-ROM,
and ISO image which created is overwritten. (If you use same area of hitmen(USA or Europe?)
version of PSX, hitlice in Hitmen provide easy way. but it dosn't work on Japanese version of PSX.)
Finally, ISO image is burnt to CD-R and it is completion.
